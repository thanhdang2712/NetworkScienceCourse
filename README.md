## Course Description:
These are materials for an undergraduate course on Network Science, titled "CORE195S: Networks: Friends, Terrorists, and Epidemics", developed for first and second year students of the bachelor degree at Colgate University. The interdisciplinary course provides a broad overview of network, science-addressing the computational techniques of networkscience as well as their applications and implications in biology, sociology, technology, and other fields.

Across this course, students will build networks in a variety of fields, demonstrating that social networks, the Internet, and cells are more alike than they are distinct-revealing crucial new insights into the linked world around us. Aside from the simple structural properties of real-world networks, the course will also cover topics such as dynamic network activities, including epidemics, network robustness, and communities in networks. Students will also discuss the societal effects and implications of network analysis. Students will have the opportunity to apply what they've learned about network science to real-world network data sets of their own choice. 

## Course Objectives:
- Understand and apply basic network science techniques.
- Know how to execute network analysis in Python and `networkx`.
- Know how to use network science on real-life datasets and properly interpret results.

## Course Resources:
- Network Science, Albert-László Barabási, Cambridge University Press (2016)
- Network Analysis Made Simple, Eric Ma and Mridul Seth, LeanPub (2022)
